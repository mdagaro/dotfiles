# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. They can be installed on any machine by calling ```sh install.sh```. This also installs my vimrc. **THIS WILL OVERWRITE YOUR CURRENT FILES**.

## bashrc
A file called `.bashrc_local` will also be created to allow for localized changes.

## gitconfig
The git config does not currently store my name and username. This note reminds me to update those values.

## vimrc
The vimrc is a fork from **INSERT NAME HERE** and is thus listed as a submodule. To update the vimrc and the vimrc's submodules, run ```git submodule update --init --recursive```
